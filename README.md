Project README

This project consists of assembly language code targeting a Motorola microprocessor architecture. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides direct control over hardware resources, making it suitable for applications requiring precise hardware interaction.

Project Overview:
-----------------

The project contains assembly code segments implementing various procedures and algorithms, including initialization routines, character printing, scanning, and interrupt handling.

File Structure:
----------------

The project directory includes the following files:

- main.asm: This file contains the main program logic, including initialization, printing, scanning, and interrupt handling routines.
- bib_aux.s: This file likely includes additional utility functions or subroutines required by the main program.
- README.md: This README file provides an overview of the project, file descriptions, and usage instructions.

Usage:
------

To use the code:

1. Ensure you have the appropriate toolchain and environment set up for assembling and running assembly code targeting Motorola microprocessors.
2. Compile or assemble the main.asm file along with any required subroutines or utility files.
3. Load the assembled binary onto the target microprocessor or emulator.
4. Execute the program on the target platform, following any specific instructions or input requirements.

Note: Detailed instructions for compiling, loading, and executing the code may vary depending on the specific microprocessor architecture and development environment.
